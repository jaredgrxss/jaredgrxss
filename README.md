# Hi, I’m Jared

I’m a backend developer currently working in payments infrastructure. I enjoy building reliable systems, contributing to open source, and writing.

Most of my work is in TypeScript and Ruby, but I also find time to explore other technologies such as Vue and Kubernetes. Mostly I like thinking about developer tools, backend architecture, and the trade-offs behind system design. 

These things excite me, but in reality it is more about the complexity that comes with each of these problem domains.

Outside of work, I write on my [blog](https://your-blog-link.com) and spend time outdoors and in video games.
