# Hi, I’m Jared

I’m a developer currently working in payments infrastructure. 

I spend most of my time in TypeScript and Ruby, but I also find time to explore other technologies such as Vue and Kubernetes. In general, I like thinking about product decisions, crafting backend architecture, and writing code.
