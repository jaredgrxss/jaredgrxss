# Hi, I’m Jared

I’m a backend developer currently working in payments infrastructure. I enjoy coding, writing, and business. 

Most of my work is in TypeScript and Ruby, but I also find time to explore other technologies such as Vue and Kubernetes. Mostly I like thinking about product decisions, backend architecture, and the trade-offs behind system design.
